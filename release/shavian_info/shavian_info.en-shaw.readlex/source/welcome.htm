  <h1>Start Using Shaw ReadLex</h1>
  <h1>Wordlist Model Documentation</h1>
  <p>The Shaw ReadLex lexical model is a wordlist ordered by frequency in the British National Corpus and spelled in the Shavian alphabet. The spellings adopted are those in the Kingsley Read Lexicon published by Shavian.info at <a href="https://www.shavian.info/dictionary/">https://www.shavian.info/dictionary/</a>, which is ultimately derived from the "rhotic Received Pronunciation" standard used in the Shaw Alphabet edition of Androcles and the Lion (1962).</p>
  <p>Shaw ReadLex is intended for use with the Shavian Alphabet keyboards available for Keyman. When installed, it provides these keyboards with a rudimentary predictive text capability that reduces typographic errors and increases speed.</p>
